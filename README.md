- I am a student at Brigham Young University majoring in Applied and Computational Mathematics with a concentration in AI and Machine Learning. I am also minoring in Computer Science and Statistics, and am earning a Dutch language certificate.
- I enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex challenges in mathematics, computer science, data science, and machine learning. I see each problem as a puzzle to solve and I get attached to it until I find the answer!I enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex challenges in mathematics, computer science, data science, and machine learning.
